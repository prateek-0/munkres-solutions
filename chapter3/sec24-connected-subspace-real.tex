\subsubsection{Problem}
Let $f : S^1 \to \R$ be a continuous map. Show that there exists a point $x$ of $S^1$ such that $f(x) = f(-x)$.

\subsubsection{Solution}
Let $g : S^1 \to \R$ be defined by $g(x) = f(x) - f(-x)$. $g$ is continuous. Consider the image of $g$. If it is $\{0\}$, then we are done, because in fact for every $x \in S^1$, $f(x) = f(-x)$.

Otherwise, for some $x \in S^1$, $g(x) \neq 0$. Then $g(-x) = -g(x)$. The image of $g$ in $\R$ contains a positive number and a negative number, and is connected (since $S^1$ is connected), so must contain $0$.
