\subsubsection{Problem}
Let $H$ be a subspace of $G$. Show that if $H$ is also a subgroup of $G$, then both $H$ and $\bar H$ are topological groups.

\subsubsection{Solution}
Since $H$ is a subspace of a $T_1$ space, $H$ is $T_1$ too. The multiplication and inverse functions on $H$ are obtained by restricting the domain and codomain of the ones on $G$, and so are continuous. So $H$ is a topological group. In particular, every subgroup of $G$ with the subspace topology is a topological group.

Let $m : G \times G \to G$ and $i : G \to G$ be the multiplication and inverse functions respectively. Using basic group properties, $i(H) = H$ and $m(H \times H) = H$. Using the continuity of $m$ and $i$,
\begin{itemize}
\item $i(\bar H) \subseteq \overline{i(H)} = \bar H$.
\item $m(\bar H \times \bar H) = m(\overline{H \times H}) \subseteq \overline{m(H \times H)} = \bar H$.
\end{itemize}
$\bar H$ contains the identity and is closed under inverses and multiplication, so $\bar H$ is a subgroup of $G$. Thus $\bar H$ is a topological group.
